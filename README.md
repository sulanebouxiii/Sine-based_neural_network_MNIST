# Sine-based_neural_network_MNIST
This is a function oriented sine-based neural network (SNN) written in processing without using libraries. It is structured in a easy to read fashion hoping to help beginners better understand how a neural network functions.
I wrote this when I was trying to learn to code my own neural network and found it hard to track all the functions and variables in Object Oriented Programing. So I wrote this one in functions. And I structured the code following the shape of this SNN so it is easy on brains.
